      <description>&lt;p&gt;So this website is so pretty? Right? OMG. There was an incredible amount of management required. For example, he kept distracting me with questions that really didn&amp;rsquo;t seem to matter and involved showing me things that looked like this &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Arlo has an interesting ability to focus, especially when it comes to games. I&amp;rsquo;ll never forget my introduction to cooperative games.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Oh you&amp;rsquo;ll love them, let&amp;rsquo;s have a game night … we&amp;rsquo;ll drink whiskey and have charcuterie … and we&amp;rsquo;ll play a game.&amp;ldquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not that I obsess over flowers - it&amp;rsquo;s just that I want to smell them, look at them, eat them, and have them around me constantly. So when Arlo said &amp;ldquo;so where should we eat&amp;rdquo;, for some unknown reason he thought the decision rubric was based on food.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
