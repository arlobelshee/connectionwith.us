      <description>Hey, just a quick warning. If you can see this, then there&#39;s a lot of this site you can&#39;t see. Oh, and we also won&#39;t be ableto save anything or notice when you ask to be invited to stuff.Please turn on javascript.

      <description>Heather has written up some wonderful stories, but Arlo is too slow at websites, so they aren&amp;rsquo;t here yet.
Come back in a couple of days. They should be up by Friday.
They&amp;rsquo;re funny. They have pictures. Oh, and you will also be able to upload your own pictures (to flickr) and have them appear with stories. In case you have more &amp;ldquo;evidence&amp;rdquo; to support some of the wild accusations.</description>
