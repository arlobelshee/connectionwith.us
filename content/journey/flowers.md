It's not that I obsess over flowers - it's just that I want to smell them, look at them, eat them, and have them around me constantly. So when Arlo said "so where should we eat", for some unknown reason he thought the decision rubric was based on food.<!--more-->

I, on the other hand, understood that the outcome was all about photos, wine, and flowers, so my rubric was ambiance and the wine list. So in Boston's Little Italy, Arlo received the joy of us walking most of the streets and me doing a strict compare and contrast of the window boxes and views from the window boxes. Oh, and a table next the window boxes being available.

Because â€¦ these pictures :)

(and of course sipping the afternoon away)
