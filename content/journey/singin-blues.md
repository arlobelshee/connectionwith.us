So it turns out, when you hang all over each other, people assume that it's a special occasion. It sort of was … we were only a year into our 3k mile distance relationship, so yeah, any time we were together was a VERY SPECIAL occasion!

It's not entirely clear who got the anniversary thing going (actually I think it was a random local in a restaurant), but many people congratulated us across the different venues until we decided, YES, this is indeed a one-year anniversary of us, just perhaps not their perception of it :)

So … we basked in the literal adoration that Atlanta gave us … our outfits … how we showed up … our snuggles.

And Arlo got to enjoy what the South assumes is normal … the glorious Blues ….

The real moral of this story is the anniversary situation though. After that one-year incident, it was over for poor Arlo. He had no idea anniversaries meant gifts. He is now educated, although I may need assistance in helping him understand there is a HUGE step up required between "dating" anniversary and "committed" anniversary … we'll see how he handles 12 January 2019 :heart: :smile:

[ed note: 12 Jan 2019 isn't an anniversary yet, is it? I thought you at least got one free year. Are anniversaries zero-indexed now?! And if so, where does the anniversary fit into the wedding day? I mean, anniversaries involve breakfast in bed and the ceremony isn't until the evening, so...so confusing! :confused:]
