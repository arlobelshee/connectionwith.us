{{< img-post path="permalink" file="editor-window.png" type="left" >}}So this website is so pretty? Right? OMG. There was an incredible amount of management required. For example, he kept distracting me with questions that really didn't seem to matter and involved showing me things that looked like this ...<!--more-->

{{< img-post path="permalink" file="website-with-error.png" type="right" >}}Meanwhile, all I could see was this ...

So when I asked for him to start the story of the ceremony and what would happen with pictures and narratives, I thought it would be nice to have a scroll that basically introduced the narrative with something like "let's get this party started!" Simple, right?

Time passed. He talked about some stuff but honestly I have no idea what he was saying and Jodi Picoult's small great things was much more enticing then something about computers and code and ... well, unsure because I was reading.

More time passed. He pronounces victory. And showed me THAT image above. In that moment, I thought "what in the world is that? Oh! The scroll; I had forgotten that. Interesting. Wow. Was he working on that this whole time? Well, it's not at all what I wanted before I had forgotten."

At this point, I'm getting used to the "yes dear, now back to what I'm actually asking about" ... even though he continues to not see the value of the formatting or image perfection. He has made a few subtle comments on my skills as a Project Manager, but I suspect it wasn't the compliment that I took it as.

Also, when I said "Oh, we should share these awesome stories of how well we work together on the website" he really jumped at the idea and said I should start writing those up ... right now. Feeling a bit like I was just given a binky.
