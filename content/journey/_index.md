## You can play along!

Each of these stories grabs its related pictures from Flickr. Which means that any pictures you post to Flickr will appear right alongside ours. Heather doesn't want you to know that, because she wants to carefully curate what appears on our site.

I believe more in trusting my friends to make a hilarious result.

Each story shows the Flickr tag to use. Post an image, add the tag, and it will appear in the flow for that story!

We will keep updating stories before, during, and after the ceremony. Come back, or
