Arlo has an interesting ability to focus, especially when it comes to games. I'll never forget my introduction to cooperative games.

"Oh you'll love them, let's have a game night … we'll drink whiskey and have charcuterie … and we'll play a game."<!--more-->

In truth, he had me at whiskey and charcuterie … and I've thrown enough gaming parties that nothing about this seemed scary. What he MEANT was pulling down a box the size of my luggage, taking 30 minutes to just sort the cards with the only interaction with me being "what character would you like to play?"

Finally, we get to start! YAY!

Villain plays. [villain is just thegame itself facilitated by Arlo] \
Somehow the villain gets another turn? \
The villain responds to the previous turn. Dear god. When do the people play? \
Finally, Arlo's turn. He responds to the villain. \
The villain retaliates!!! \
Arlo responds. \

Yes, Arlo is literally playing with himself in the most boring way possible. I wander off and return with a new drink. He doesn't notice.

I look at his face … he is so intense! Wow. It's not even like he's having to choose between Chanel or Tod sunglasses either. That is a much more crucial decision. Or what 10 pairs of shoes to take for a weekend getaway. What can be so interesting about reading a LOT of cards and responding by reading cards from different stacks?

I wander off again … and then I get curious.

_I take off all my clothes and stand there._ Nothing.

This picture, ladies and gentlemen, is taken by me being completely naked.
