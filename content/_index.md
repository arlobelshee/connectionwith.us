You live all over the place. So we're doing our showers virtually.

## Some really important info we need from you!

We've got 2 days of festivities! "They" tell us it's important to keep everyone hydrated, and each event has a different ambiance. Thus many different forms of hydration.

So what do you like to drink?

There will be serious tea and mad tea, skiing and dancing and a conference. We're bringing together all sorts of parts of us. Join us! Weave yourself in.

And if you drink at every opportunity provided, expect to weave yourself out too.
