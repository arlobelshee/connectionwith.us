## Some really important info we need from you!

We've got 2 days of festivities! "They" tell us it's important to keep everyone hydrated, and each event has a different ambiance. Thus many different forms of hydration.

So what do you like to drink?

### Do I need a car?

We will ensure that all events on Friday and Saturday are either walking friendly to access or easy to car pool.

### Where's the ceremony?

Right downtown Boulder at Rembrandt Yard â€¦ it's directly across from the Hotel Boulderado and a block from the popular downtown walking district.

### Where should I stay?

#### Hotel Boulderado

Fantastic place to stay for the history lover and doesn't want to drive at all or walk far to anything!

#### St. Julien's Hotel & Spa

The modern spa hotel that is quite nice; easy walking to everything, with no driving required while in town.

#### Alps Boulder Canyon Inn

The cozy mountain getaway with fireplaces everywhere (including your room) and great breakfasts. Must have car to drive the 15m up the mountain highway from downtown Boulder.

### How should I get to Boulder from the airport (DIA)?

#### Bus

One way ticket into Downtown Boulder Station will run $9 and run approximately 90 minutes - [Westbound Schedule (from DIA to Downtown Boulder Station)](http://www3.rtd-denver.com/schedules/getSchedule.action?runboardId=2591&routeId=AB&routeType=9&&direction=W-Bound&serviceType=3#direction)

This [mobile app](http://www.rtd-denver.com/mobileticket.shtml) allows you to pre-purchase your tickets for easier travel.

Great option if you just want to get here.

#### Shared Car Service

Uber or Lyft will cost approximately 75$ one way and run about 50 minutes. Shared car services run out of Doors 601-608 on either the West or East side.

Good option if you just want to slip into town and plan on staying downtown / city centre.

#### Car Rental

Shuttle service is available to and from car rental lots near airport.

Best option if you want to do any driving while visiting Boulder.

### Can I join the skiing without a car?

If you wish to join us for the Sunday skiing, please confirm your interest on the website so that we can arrange the best transit options, whether we do a car pooling excursion or rent a larger vehicle.

### What kind of fun things should I do?



### Boulder is known its food, beer, oxford commas, and marijuana ... help me pick the best options!
