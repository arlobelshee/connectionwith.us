{{% band bg-photo="img/ski-day.jpg" bg="dark" id="ski-day" %}}

### Skiing!

Before our honeymoon starts, we want to take a day skiing. You are all welcome to join us on the slopes at Loveland.

We will rent a cabin low on the slopes. Beer and chili.

We are checking on cabin access for non-skiiers.
