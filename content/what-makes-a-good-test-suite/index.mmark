I was talking with Llewellyn Falco the other day (now many days back) about test suites. At some point, I asked him for his opinion to a not-so-simple question:

> What are the characteristics of a good test suite?

He gave me a good answer. And that made me curious --- how would other people answer this question? What commonalities and differences would emerge?

So I asked the same question to a bunch of people that I thought would give interesting answers. Here's what they had to say.
