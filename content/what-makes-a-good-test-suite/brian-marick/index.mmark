[Brian Marick](http://exampler.com/ "Brian's blog") challenges people's thinking. When we get long winded, he asks us for an example. When we said TDD was great, he asked us to prove it. HeÂ challenges us to achieve 4 things at all times: discipline, skill, ease, and joy.

And when we water down our agile approach, he challenges us to take up (even to understand) [Artisanal Retro-Futurism crossed with Team-Scale Anarcho-Syndicalism](http://www.arxta.net/).

I asked Brian the same question that I asked [everyone else](http://arlobelshee.com/what-makes-a-good-test-suite "What makes a good test suite?"):

> What are the characteristics of a good test suite?

# Brian's Answer

That's a hugely situation-dependent question. I don't think I can say anything useful.

Love (or hate) that answer? Want to see [other answers](http://arlobelshee.com/what-makes-a-good-test-suite "What makes a good test suite?")?
